## 📘 About the Project

**Consulting firms** provide expert advice to businesses across various domains—IT, finance, marketing, HR, and more. These firms manage multiple **clients**, **consultants**, and **projects** simultaneously. Tracking who’s working on what, for how long, and how much to bill—can get complicated fast.

This MySQL-based project aims to **digitize and simplify** the entire workflow.
